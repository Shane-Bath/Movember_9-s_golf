<!-- ROUGH DRAFT -->

## Movember 9's Golf Society
The site is to promote an annual charity nine-hole golf event to raise money for the Movember menâ€™s health charity. The Website main purpose is to provide information on the event and to allow individuals to book a place.


## Design
I have looked at the main Movember charity website and decided to adopt a similar style and tone with this page, because to of the association between the two. Movenber does provide assets such as banner images, logo and promotional material to supporters who are setting up an event in support of the charity. There is a strong black and white theme throughout the site, along with an irreverent style of communication. I have focused the design to be viewed on a small screen first, will be able to scroll through the relevant section or use the navigation bar to head directly each section. 

I am using the same fon-family as the main website. It is a google font called overpass. 




## Navigation bar
- I have used a Banner picture from the Movember branding pack for the top banner. 
- I have included the Movember Logo. Clicking this logo will always bring the user to the home page. 
- A fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the all the pages, including the 
  Home page, Location page and contact us page. 
- The Banner picture, logo and navigation bar remain fixed on very page on the site.

## Locations page
- Details on each location, along with date and time. 
- The main image has a link to a hidden gallery page with more picture of each venue.
- Booking button, will bring you to a booking page.

## Booking page
- Simple booking page that only require the name, email, drop down list to select the course and the number of guest. 
- Above the form will be two images of each golf course, again these images are link to the gallery. Within the gallery there is a link back to the booking form.
