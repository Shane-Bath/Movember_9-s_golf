## Design
I have taken inspiration from the Movember charity website and decided to adopt a similar style and tone, because to of the association between the two.  There is a strong black and white theme throughout the site, along with an irreverent style of communication. 





## Navigation bar
- I have used a Banner picture from the Movember branding pack for the top banner. 
- I have included the Movember Logo. Source: xxxxxxxxx      Clicking this logo will always bring the user to the home page. 
- A fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the all the pages, including the 
  Home page, Location page and contact us page. 
- The Banner picture, logo and navigation bar remain fixed on very page on the site.

- Booking button, will bring you to a booking page.

## Booking page
- Simple booking page that only require the name, email, drop down list to select the course and the number of guest. 
- Above the form will be two images of each golf course, again these images are link to the gallery. Within the gallery there is a link back to the booking form.
