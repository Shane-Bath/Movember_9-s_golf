            <h2>MO 9's The Nine hole golf charity event</h2>
            <p>Movember 9’s is a nine-hole charity golf event in support of Movember to raise awareness and money
                for
                testicular cancer. We gather every year in the cold to shoot the lights out in a fast
                paced nine-hole golf tournament, so we can be back in the club house bar in under two hours, before
                the
                onset of hypothermia. Rasing money for testicular cancer should not be a test of one’s endurance, so
                if
                you think the nine-holes,
                shotgun start, better ball format is appropriate for your delicate disposition, <a href="#">sign up

            <h1 id="about">About us</h1>
            <p>Established in 2020 we started to host a bi-annual nine hole golf event in support of Movember.

                The Mo 9's Golf Society is committed to helping men live happier, healthier and longer lives. We
                raise money through golf events which are open to all members of the public. We believe golf is
                about more than just playing on the course. It’s about making connections and helping each other.
                Our members come from all walks of life, united in a common goal to raise money for charity and have
                fun doing it!
                We strive to provide an enjoyable experience for all our members. We take pride in organizing golf
                events that bring people together and we strive to create an atmosphere of camaraderie and friendly
                competition. We look forward to meeting you on the course and in the bar. </p>
