                Movember 9’s is a nine-hole charity golf event in support of Movember to raise awareness and money for
                testicular cancer. We gather every year in the cold to shoot the lights out in a fast
                paced nine-hole golf tournament, so we can be back in the club house bar in under two hours, before the
                onset of hypothermia. Rasing money for testicular cancer should not be a test of one’s endurance, so if
                you think the nine-holes,
                shotgun start, better ball format is appropriate for your delicate disposition, sign up today.

                A combination of a dry fast fairways and greens, usually accompanied by a refreshing breeze off the
                Irish sea, this course provides a challenge to wayward golfer but to the ‘down the middle’ amongst us,
                an opportunity to clean up the accolades and prizes. </p>

                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
